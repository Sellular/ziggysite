                        Client is my cat from home, Ziggy. Client is not me
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Header is present on every normally visible page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Site contains 6 pages, each with a purpose
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Site contains navigation bar leading to all pages
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On Android and Desktop my website displays fine, for some reason on iOS I guess it does not, however I don't have an Apple device to test it and all my mobile format testing on desktop Firefox/Google Chrome and on my own phone (Samsung Galaxy S9+) it has displayed fine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Global style is in master.css and individual pages have their own .css file
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All images have alt attributes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Favicon is declared on each page

                    <li>
                        images, styles, and scripts folders used
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No additional frameworks/libraries used
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        HTML validator and CSS validator passes each page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Site is on github and shared link with instructor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All html/js related files are lowercase
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        port 8443 is used
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        site uses HTTPS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Axes clearly defined and site is structured around them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two different fonts used. Not the normal sans/sans-serif fonts, but ones that I feel fit the page nicely
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Form used in 'Contact Me' page. The action doesn't do much, just clears out when submit button is pressed and triggers text to show
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Links to facebook and twitter used in Contact Me page and they point to _blank for new tab
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        source code, in my opinion, is readable with proper camelcase/format for names and tabbing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        animation in header, Ziggy's head flipping every few seconds. Powered by javascript
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                Overall - very well done.  Very humorous!  Love the cat point of view.  Matthew was disappointed Ziggy didn't have his own FB or twitter account.  Desktop the website flows smoothly.   Everything looked fine on Android as well. We like Ziggy's moving head on the top.
                <br/><br/>A couple of things on Apple, the schedule overlaps with everything (time overlaps with sentences) so you can't read it.  On the family section, the names Zoey and Peter overlap a little onto the photo in portrait.  Landscape it is fine. Also the contact page fields overlap a little with the FB & Twitter icons. Dad will send you screen shots so you can see.
                <br/><br/>Hope this helps!
