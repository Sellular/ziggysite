                            What a FANTASTIC day! This morning, when I followed Peter out of the bedroom, he got his morning coffee as usual, but today he gave me a few treats before 6am! Later that day, Matthew was making lunch and surprised me with a few more treats that he snuck me while making his sandwich.
