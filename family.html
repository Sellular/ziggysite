                            This is my house-cat-mate, Zoey! She's a bit moody sometimes, not always fond of being chased around, but I can't help it all the time. We still get along well though, we cuddle just about every day!

                            This guy holds a soft spot in my heart. During the first week or so of living with this amazing family, he spent a lot of time with me. Giving me attention, making sure I'm acclimating well, etc. Eric has been a great friend for the last 5+ years!

                            Lynn is the mother of my family but seems to hold a favorite in Zoey. Granted, I get my share of attention from her, but Zoey is constantly begging for and getting attention from Lynn and she seems happy to give it :(

                            Peter is what I look for in a companion. He's always willing to give me attention and treats, probably my favorite person to share lap time with, and always tucks me under blankets for my naps!

                            Matthew, the youngest in the family, has been very affectionate since he's been home in this time of quarantine. Granted, he's going crazy without going to school, but it's been nice to have him home!
